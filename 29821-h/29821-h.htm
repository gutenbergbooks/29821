<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>When a small impression of these quaint old books issued from the
Chiswick Press, many years ago, under the auspices of the late Mr. S. W.
Singer, that gentleman merely designed the copies struck off for
presentation to a select circle of literary friends who, like himself,
felt a warm interest in every relic of the past which helped to
illustrate Shakespeare and ancient English manners. He did not
consequently feel under the necessity of furnishing notes, and he
preserved not only the old orthography, but the old punctuation, and the
most palpable errors of the press. His edition unfortunately laboured
under one disadvantage: when he printed, in 1814, the <i>Mery Tales and
Quick Answers</i> from Berthelet's edition, he imagined that this was the
book to which Beatrice is made to allude in <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> under this idea he christened the volume <i>Shakespeare's Jest Book</i>.
He also thought he was safe in assuming that the edition by Berthelet
was the only one extant. But Mr. Singer discovered, before his
undertaking was a year old, that he had come to an erroneous conclusion
on both these points: for an impression of the <i>Mery Tales, &amp;c.</i> printed
by Henry Wykes in 1567, and containing, with all the old matter,
twenty-six additional stories, was brought under his notice, and about
the same time a totally unknown work, bearing the very title mentioned
by Beatrice, was accidentally rescued from oblivion by the Rev. J. J.
Conybeare, who, it is said by Dunlop, picked up the treasure at a
bookstall. This was no other than <span class="smcap">A C. Mery Talys</span>.</p>

<p>The copy of <i>C. Mery Talys</i> thus casually brought to light, had been
used by a binder of or about the time of its appearance as pasteboard to
another book, and it was in this state when it fell in the way of Mr.
Conybeare. As might have been expected, many of the leaves were damaged
and mutilated; but (which rendered the matter still more curious) it
happily chanced that <i>more than one copy</i> had been employed by the
aforesaid binder in fashioning the aforesaid pasteboard, and the
consequence was that a much larger fragment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> than would have been
otherwise saved was formed by means of duplicate leaves. Still several
gaps in the text remained, which it was found impossible to fill up, and
as no other copy has since occurred, no better means exist now than
existed fifty years ago of supplying the deficiencies. Where the hiatus
consisted of a word or two only, and the missing portion could be
furnished by conjecture, Mr. Singer took the liberty of adding what
seemed to be wanting, in italics; his interpolations have been left as
they stood. The old orthography and language, besides the charm of
quaintness, appeared to the editor to possess a certain philological
value, and he has rigidly adhered to it. In respect to the punctuation,
the case was different; there were no reasons of any kind for its
retention; it was very imperfect and capricious; and it has therefore
been modernized throughout.</p>

<p>The <i>C. Mery Talys</i>, of which the copy above described has a fair
pretention to the distinction of uniqueness, were first printed by John
Rastell, without date but circa 1525, in folio, 24 leaves. Whether
Rastell printed more than one edition is an open question. The book was
not reprinted, so far as we know at present, till 1558, when John Walley
or Waley paid two shillings to the Stationers' Company for his licence
to produce this and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> pieces. Walley reprinted a great number of
books which had originally come from the press of Wynkyn de Worde and
other early masters of the art, but it is not very likely that the <i>C.
Mery Talys</i> made their appearance prior to 1525, and there is room to
doubt whether even then the severe reflections on the scandalous lives
of the Roman Catholic priesthood were not slightly premature. The almost
total destruction of copies may be, after all, due, not to the excessive
popularity of the publication, but to its early suppression by authority
or otherwise. After the triumph of the Reformation, and until the death
of Edward VI. however, although these tales still remained as
unpalatable as ever to a certain party, there was nothing to hinder
their circulation, and that there were intermediate impressions between
that from Rastell's press, and the one licensed to Walley,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> if not
printed by him, is not at all improbable. The <i>C. Mery Talys</i> were
subsequently and successively the property of Sampson Awdley and John
Charlwood, to the latter of whom they were licensed on the 15th January,
1582. All trace of editions by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> Walley, Awdley, or Charlwood, has
disappeared, although doubtless all three printed the work.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Mery Tales and Quicke Answeres</span>, which forms the second portion of
the present volume, only two impressions are known. One of these,
supposed to be the original, was printed by Thomas Berthelet, without
date (about 1535), in 4to.; it contains 114 anecdotes. The other, from
the press of Henry Wykes, bears the date 1567, and is in the duodecimo
form; it produces with tolerable exactness the text of Berthelet, and
has twenty-six new stories. Besides these, at least one other impression
formerly existed: for, in 1576-7, Henry Bynneman paid to the Stationers'
Company fourpence "and a copie" for "a booke entituled mery tales,
wittye questions, and quycke answers."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> No copy of Bynneman's edition
has hitherto been discovered; a copy of that of 1567 was in the Harleian
library. At the sale of the White-Knights collection in 1819, Mr. George
Daniel of Canonbury gave nineteen guineas for the exemplar of
Berthelet's undated 4to, which had previously been in the Roxburghe
library, and which at the dispersion of the latter in 1812, had fetched
the moderate sum of 5<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The reader who is conversant with this class of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> literature will easily
recognise in the following pages many stories familiar to him either in
the same, or in very slightly different, shapes; a few, which form part
of the <i>Mery Tales and Quick Answers</i>, were included in a collection
published many years since under the title of <i>Tales of the Minstrels</i>.
No. 42 of the <i>Mery Tales and Quick Answers</i> was perhaps at one time
rather popular as a theme for a joke. There is an Elizabethan ballad
commencing, "ty the mare, tom-boy, ty the mare," by William Keth, which
the editor thought, before he had had an opportunity of examining it,
might be on the same subject; but he finds that it has nothing whatever
to do with the matter.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It may also be noticed that the story related
of the king who, to revenge himself on God, forbade His name to be
mentioned, or His worship to be celebrated throughout his dominions, is
said by Montaigne, in one of his essays, to have been current in his
part of France, when he was a boy. The king was Alfonso xi of Castile.
No. 68 of <i>A C. Mery Talys</i>, "Of the Friar that stole the Pudding," is
merely an abridgment of the same story, which occurs in <i>Tarltons Newes
out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> Purgatorie</i>, where it is told of the "Vickar of Bergamo." Many
of the jests in these two pamphlets are also to be found in <i>Scoggins
Jests</i>, licensed in 1565; a few occur in the <i>Philosopher's Banquet</i>,
1614; and one&mdash;that where the lady ties a string to her toe as a signal
to her lover&mdash;is repeated at greater length in the "Cobler of
Canterbury," edit. 1608, where it is called "the old wives' tale." It
would be a curious point to ascertain whether the anecdotes common to
these collections and to "<i>Scoggin's Jests</i>," do not refer to the same
person; and whether Scoggin is not in fact the hero of many of the
pranks attributed to the "Scholar of Oxford," the "Youngman," the
"Gentleman," &amp;c. in the following pages, which were in existence many
years before the first publication of <i>Scoggins Jests</i>. It will hardly
be contested at the present day, that "books of the people,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> like
these now reprinted, with all their occasional coarseness and frequent
dulness, are of extreme and peculiar value, as illustrations of early
manners and habits of thought.</p>

<p>The editor has ventured to make certain emendations of the text, where
they were absolutely necessary to make it intelligible; but these are
always carefully noted at the foot of the page<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> where they occur. A word
or two, here and there, has been introduced between brackets to complete
the sense; and a few notes have been given, since it was thought
desirable to point out where a tale was common to several collections in
various shapes or in the same shape, to indicate the source from which
it was derived, and to elucidate obscure phrases or passages. But he has
refrained from overloading the book with comment, from a feeling that,
in the majority of cases, the class of readers, to which a publication
such as this addresses itself, are fully as competent to clear up any
apparent difficulties which may fall in their way, as himself.</p>

<p>The allusions to the <i>C. Mery Talys</i> and to its companion in old writers
are sufficiently numerous.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Bathe, in his <i>Introduction to the Art of Musick</i>, 1584, says: "But for
the worthiness I thought it not to be doubted, seeing here are set forth
a booke of a hundred mery tales, another of the bataile between the
spider and the flie, &amp;c." A few years later, Sir John Harington, in his
<i>Apologie</i>(for the <i>Metamorphosis of Ajax</i>) 1596, writes: "Ralph Horsey,
Knight, the best housekeeper in Dorset<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>shire, a good freeholder, a
deputie Lieutenant. Oh, sir, you keep hauks and houndes, and hunting
horses: it may be som madde fellowe will say, you must stand up to the
chinne, for spending five hundred poundes, to catch hares, and
Partridges, that might be taken for five poundes." Then comes this note
in the margin: "according to the tale in the hundred Mery Tales." It is
No. 57. In the Epilogue to the play of <i>Wily Beguild</i>, printed in 1606,
but written during the reign of Elizabeth, there is a passage in which
the <i>C. Mery Talys</i> are coupled with <i>Scoggins Jests</i>, and in his
<i>Wonderful yeare</i>, 1603, Decker says: "I could fill a large volume, and
call it the second part of the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>, only with such
ridiculous stuff as this of the justice." From this extract, first
quoted by Mr. Collier in his valuable History of the Drama, and from the
manner in which Shakespeare, through the mouth of Beatrice, speaks of
the <i>Mery Talys</i>, it is to be gathered that neither writer held this
book of jests in very high estimation; and, as no vestiges are traceable
of an edition of the work subsequent to 1582, it is possible that about
that time the title had grown too stale to please the less educated
reader, and the work had fallen into disrepute in higher quarters. The
stories themselves, in some shape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> or other, however, have been
reproduced in every jest-book from the reign of Elizabeth to the
Restoration, while many of them multiply themselves even to the present
day in the form of chap books.</p>

<p><i>A C. Mery Talys</i> was one of the popular tracts described by the
pedantic Laneham, in his <i>Letter from Kenilworth</i>, 1575, as being in the
Library of Captain Cox, of Coventry.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h3>&para; <i>Of the man that had the dome wyfe.</i> lx.</h3>


<p>&para; There was a man that maryed a woman whiche
had great ryches and beautie; howe be it she had
suche an impedyment of nature, that she was
domme and coulde nat speke. Whiche thinge
made him to be ryght pensyfe and sadde; wherfore,
vpon a day as he walked alone ryght heuy in
harte, thynkynge vpon his wyfe, there came one to
him and asked hym, what was the cause of his
heuynesse; whiche answered that it was onely
because his wife was borne domme. To whome
this other sayde: I shall shewe the sone a remedye
and a medecyne therfore, that is thus: go take an
aspen lefe and laye it vnder her tonge this nyght,
she beynge a slepe; and I warante the that she
shall speke on the morowe. Whiche man, beynge
glad of this medycyne, prepared therfore and
gathered aspyn leaues; wherfore he layde thre of
them vnder her tonge, when she was a slepe. And
on the morowe whan he hymselfe awaked, he, desyrous
to knowe howe his medecyne wrought,
beynge in bedde with her, he demaunded of her
howe she dyd; and sodenly she answered and
sayd: I beshrowe your harte for wakenynge me so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>erly; and so by the virtue of that medycyne she
was restored to her speche. But in conclusyon
her speche so encreased day by day, and she was
so curste of condycyon, that euery daye she brauled
and chydde with her husbande so moche, that at
the laste he was more vexed, and hadde moche
more trouble and disease with her shrewde wordes,
than he hadde before whan she was dome. Wherfore,
as he walked another tyme abrode, he happened
to meate agayne with the same persone that
taughte <i>hym howe to make his wyfe speke</i><a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>and more wery of her nowe than I was before, whan she was domme;
wherfore I praye you teche me a medycyne to modefye her, that she speke
nat so moche. This other answered and sayd thus: syr, I am a deuyll of
hell; but I am one of them that haue leste power there. All be it yet I
haue power to make a woman to speke, but and if a woman begyn ones to
speke, I, nor all the deuyls in hell that haue the more power, be nat
able to make a woman to be styll, nor to cause her to leaue her
spekynge.</p>

<p>As this story in the <i>C. Mery Talys</i> is defective in consequence of the
mutilation of the only known copy, the foregoing extract becomes
valuable, as it exhibits what was probably the sequel in the prose

doubt a borrower.</p>

angels might stand on the point of a needle, another replied, 'That was

<p>P. <a href='#Page_106'><b>106</b></a>. Scot, in his <i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i>, 1584, ed. 1651, p. 191,
has a story, which bears the mark of being the same as the one here
entitled "Of the parson that stale the mylner's elys." The passage in
Scot, which may help to supply the unfortunate <i>lacuna</i> in the <i>C. Mery
Talys</i>, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So it was, that a certain Sir John, with some of his company, once went
abroad jetting, and in a moon-light evening, robbed a miller's weire and
stole all his eeles. The poor miller made his mone to Sir John himself,
who willed him to be quiet; for he would so curse the theef, and
all his confederates, with bell, book, and candel, that they should have
small joy of their fish. And therefore the next Sunday, Sir John got him
to the pulpit, with his surplisse on his back, and his stole about his
neck, and pronounced these words following in the audience of the
people:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'All you that have stolne the millers eeles,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Laudate Dominum de coelis</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all they that have consented thereto,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Benedicamus Domino</i>.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Lo (saith he), there is savoe for your eeles, my masters."</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_108'><b>108</b></a>. <i>Of the parson that sayde masse of requiem, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;This story is
also in <i>Scoggin's Jests</i>, 1626, and perhaps the lacun&aelig; may be supplied
from that source. Thus (the words supplied from <i>Scoggin's Jests</i> are in
italics):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then quod the prest: tel thy mayster that he must <i>say the Masse which
doth begin with a great R</i>. [when the boy returned, the Prest asked him
whether the Parson had told him what] masse, &amp;c."</p>

<p>And again, a line or two lower down, there can be no doubt, on a
comparison of Scoggin's Jests, p. 74, what the missing words are. We
ought to read:&mdash;"but he had me tell you it began <i>with a great R</i>."</p>

Papyrius, cam in with his father and herde the great counsayl the which
was straytely commaunded to be kept secrete, tyll hit was decreed. Whan
this chylde came home, his mother asked him what the counsaile was. The
chylde answered, hit oughte nat to be tolde. Now was his mother more
desyrous to knowe hit than she was before; wherfore she enquered more
straitly and more violentlye. The chylde, beinge sore constrayned of his

<p>On the morowe, a great company of the moste notable wyues of Rome came
to the parlemente house weping, and humbly prayeng, that rather one
woman shuld be maryed vnto ii men than ii wemen to one man. The
Senatours entringe into the court, what with the sodayn assembling of
the wyues and of their request, were right sore astonied. Than the
childe Papyrius stode forth, and enformed the senatours, how his mother
wold haue compelled him to vtter the secrete counsayle: and howe he, to
contente her mynde, feyned that leasynge. For which dede the Senatours
right hyghly commended the childes fydelite and wytte. And forth-with
they made a law, that no child after that (saue only Papirius) shuld
come in to the parlement house with his father. And for his great
prudence in that tender age he hadde gyuen to hym, to his great honour,
this surname <i>Pretextatus</i>.</p>

<p>Whereby ye may se, that the hygh treasure of man, and greattest grace,
rested in well-ordrynge of the tonge. The moste prudent poete Hesiodus
sayth: The tonge shulde not ronne at large, but be hydde as a precious

condemned. Bea! quod he agayne. Than his man of lawe stode forth, and
sayd: Sir, this man is but an ideot. Who wolde beleue that this
marchaunt, whiche is both wyse and subtyle, wolde truste this ideot,
that can speke neuer a redy worde, of xl peny worth of ware? and so with
suche reasons he perswaded the Justyce to caste the marchaunt in his
owne action. So whan the sentence was gyuen, the man of lawe drewe the
dettour asyde, and said: Lo, howe sayst thou nowe? Haue not I done well
for the? Thou arte clere quitte of the dette that was demanded of the:
wherfore giue me my money, and God be with the. Bea! quod he. What, quod

dispatched; all is at a poynt, there resteth nothynge but to gyue me my
wages, that thou promysyddest. Bea! quod he agayne. I saye, quod the man

<p>&para; There was a felowe dwellynge at Florence, called Nigniaca, whiche was
nat verye wyse, nor all a foole, but merye and iocunde. A sorte<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> of
yonge men, for to laughe and pastyme, appoynted to gether to make hym
beleue that he was sycke. So, whan they were agreed howe they wolde do,
one of them mette hym in the mornynge, as he came out of his house, and
bad him good morowe, and than asked him, if he were nat yl at ease? No,
quod the foole, I ayle nothynge, I thanke God. By my faith, ye haue a
sickely pale colour, quod the other, and wente his waye.</p>

<p>Anone after, an other of them mette hym, and asked hym if he had nat an
ague: for your face and colour (quod he) sheweth that ye be very sycke.
Than the foole beganne a lyttel to doubt, whether he were sycke or no:
for he halfe beleued that they sayd trouth. Whan he had gone a lytel
farther, the thyrde man mette hym, and sayde: Jesu! manne, what do you
out of your bed? ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii76" id="Page_ii76">[Pg 76]</a></span> loke as ye wolde nat lyue an houre to an ende. Nowe
he doubted greatly, and thought verily in his mynde, that he had hadde
some sharpe ague; wherfore he stode styll and wolde go no further; and,
as he stode, the fourth man came and sayde: Jesu! man, what dost thou
here, and arte so sycke? Gette the home to thy bedde: for I parceyue
thou canste nat lyue an houre to an ende. Than the foles harte beganne
to feynte,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and [he] prayde this laste man that came to hym to helpe
hym home. Yes, quod he, I wyll do as moche for the as for myn owne
brother. So home he brought hym, and layde hym in his bed, and than he
fared with hym selfe, as thoughe he wolde gyue vp the gooste. Forth with
came the other felowes, and saide he hadde well done to lay hym in his
bedde. Anone after, came one whiche toke on hym to be a phisitian;
whiche, touchynge the pulse, sayde the malady was so vehement, that he
coulde nat lyue an houre. So they, standynge aboute the bedde, sayde one
to an other: nowe he gothe his waye: for his speche and syght fayle him;
by and by he wyll yelde vp the goste. Therfore lette vs close his eyes,
and laye his hands a crosse, and cary hym forth to be buryed. And than
they sayde lamentynge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii77" id="Page_ii77">[Pg 77]</a></span> one to an other: O! what a losse haue we of this
good felowe, our frende?</p>

<p>The foole laye stylle, as one [that] were deade; yea, and thought in his
mynde, that he was deade in dede. So they layde hym on a bere, and
caryed hym through the cite. And whan any body asked them what they
caryed, they sayd the corps of Nigniaca to his graue. And euer as they
went, people drew about them. Among the prece<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> ther was a tauerners

to them: O! what a vile bestly knaue, and what a stronge thefe is deed!
by the masse, he was well worthy to haue ben hanged longe ago. Whan the
fole harde those wordes, he put out his heed and sayd: I wys, horeson,
if I were alyue nowe, as I am deed, I wolde proue the a false lyer to
thy face. They, that caryed him, began to laugh so hartilye, that they
sette downe the bere, and wente theyr waye.</p>

they went to. And bicause he so dyd, the folkes that wrought by the way
syde, blamed hym; wherfore he set vp his sonne, and went hym selfe on

yonge boye ryde, and he, beynge so aged, to goo a foote. Than he toke
downe the boye, and lepte vp and rode hym selfe. Whanne he hadde rydden

lyttell yonge boye ronne after as a seruaunte, and he his father to

<p>Anone he mette with other, that asked hym if the asse were his owne, by

lyttell sely asse, that vnethe<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> was able to beare one. Thus he,
troubled with their dyuers and manyfolde opinions; whiche, neither with
his asse vacant, nor he alone, nor his sonne alone, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii79" id="Page_ii79">[Pg 79]</a></span> bothe to gether
rydyng at ones on the asse, coulde passe forth with out detraction and

betwene them on their shulders to the towne. The noueltie of whiche
syght caused euery body to laughe and blame the folysshenes of them
both. The sely olde man was so sore agreued that, as he sat and rested
hym on a ryuers syde, he threwe his asse in to the water; and so whan he
had drowned his asse he tourned home agayne. Thus the good man,
desyrynge to please euerye bodye, contentynge none at all, loste his

<p>By this tale appereth playnelye, that they, whiche commyt them selfe to

<p>&para; There chaunced, in a certaine part of the realme, an offyce to fal
into the kings handes by the deth of a man which was worth a cccc
crounes by the yere. An honest witty gentilman, dwelling therby,
trustyng to obteyne the sayde offyce, made as good speede to the courte

kneled downe, and in most humble wise desired his grace to geue vnto hym
that offyce, declaring what it was. The king perceiuing how good an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>

<h3>MERY TALES AND QUICK ANSWERES.</h3>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii16'>16</a>. <i>Of him that preched on Saynt Christophers day.</i></p>

<p>In <i>A Booke of Meery Riddles</i>, 1617 (repr. of ed. 1629, p. 73 of Mr.
Halliwell's <i>Literature of the xvith and xviith centuries Illustrated,
&amp;c.</i> 1851), we have the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The xvii Riddle.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Who bare the best burthen that ever was borne</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At any time since, or at any time befor[n]e.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Solution.</i>&mdash;It was the asse that bare both Our Lady and her Sonne out
of Egypt."</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii21'>21</a>. <i>Of the yonge woman that sorowed so greatly her husbondes deth.</i></p>

<p>"There was a poor young Woman who had brought herself even to Death's
Door with grief for her sick Husband, but the good Man her Father did
all he could to comfort her. <i>Come, Child</i>, said he, <i>we are all mortal.
Pluck up a good heart, my Child: for let the worst come to the worst, I
have a better Husband in store for thee. Alas, Sir</i>, says she, <i>what
d'ye talk of another Husband for? Why, you had as good have stuck a
Dagger to my Heart. No, no; if ever I think of another Husband, may&mdash;!</i>
Without any more ado, the Man dies, and the Woman, immediately breaks
into such Transports of tearing her Hair, and beating her Breast, that
everybody thought she'd have run stark-mad upon it. But, upon second
Thoughts, she wipes her Eyes, lifts them up, and cries, <i>Heaven's will
be done!</i> and turning to her Father, <i>Pray Sir</i>, says she, <i>about t'
other Husband you were speaking of, is he here in the
House</i>?"&mdash;<i>Complete London Jester</i>, 1771, p. 49.</p>

<p>This story was appropriated by the editor of <i>Pasquil's Jests, mixed
with Mother Bunch's Merriments</i>, of which there were several editions,
the first appearing in 1604. In Pasquil's Jests, the tale is told of a
"young woman of Barnet."</p>

<p><i>She rowned her father in the eare.</i></p>

<p>Gower (<i>Confessio Amantis</i>, ed. Pauli, Vol. 1. p. 161) has a precisely
similar expression:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But whan they rounenin her ere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than groweth all my moste fere."</span><br />

<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii21'>21</a>. <i>Of him that kissed the mayde with the longe nose.</i></p>

<p>"'Good Sir William, let it rest' quoth shee, 'I know you will not
beleeue it when I haue reuealed it, neither is it a thing that you can
helpe: and yet such is my foolishnesse, had it not beene for that, I
thinke, verily I had granted your suite ere now. But seeing you vrge me
so much to know what it is, I will tell you: it is, sir, your
ill-fauoured great nose, that hangs sagging so lothsomely to your lips,
<i>that I cannot finde in my heart so much as to kisse you</i>.'"&mdash;<i>Pleasant
History of Thomas of Reading</i>, by T. D. circa 1597, p. 73 (ed. Thoms).</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii26'>26</a>. <i>Of the Marchaunt that lost his bodgetie betwene Ware and
Lon[don].</i></p>

<p>In <i>Pasquil's Jests</i>, 1604 occurs an account substantially similar to
the present, of "how a merchant lost his purse between
<i>Waltam</i> and London."</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii28'>28</a>. <i>Of the fatte woman that solde frute.</i></p>

<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii31'>31</a>.&mdash;Wilson introduces the "notable historie" of Papirius Pretextatus
into his <i>Rule of Reason</i>, 1551, 8<sup>o</sup>, and it had previously been related
in Caxton's <i>Game and Playe of the Chesse</i>, 1474.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii33'>33</a>. <i>Of the corrupte man of law.</i></p>

<p>"An arch Barber at a certain Borough in the West, where there are but
few Electors, had Art enough to suspend his Promise till the Voters, by
means of <i>Bribery</i>, the <i>old Balsam</i>, were so divided, that the casting
vote lay in himself. One of the Candidates, who was sensible of it,
cameinto his little dirty Shop to be shaved, and when the operation was
finish'd, threw into the Bason <i>Twenty Guineas</i>. The next Day came the
other Candidate, who was shaved also, and left <i>Thirty</i>. Some Days after
this, the first return'd to solicit the Barber's Vote, who told him very
coldly, <i>That he could not promise. Not promise!</i> says the Gentleman;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
why I thought I had been shaved here! 'Tis true, says the Barber, <i>you
was, but another Gentleman has been trimm'd</i> since that; however, if you
please, I'll trim you again, and then tell you my mind."&mdash;<i>Complete
London Jester</i>, ed. 1771, p. 99.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii35'>35</a>. <i>Conon peaked into the court.</i>&mdash;So in Skelton's <i>Colin Clout</i>
(Works by Dyce, I. 312), we have:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He cryeth and he creketh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He pryeth and he peketh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He chides and he chatters," &amp;c.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the <i>Posthums Poems of Richard Lovelace, Esq.</i> 1659, 80, p. 60, the
word is employed in a different sense:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Have you not marked their C[oe]lestial play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no more peek'd the gayties of day?"</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>To peak</i>, however, in the sense in which it is used by Skelton, and in
the <i>Merie Tales</i>, &amp;c. is of rather frequent occurrence in <i>Scoggin's
Jests</i>, 1626 (but first printed before 1565); and Gascoigne employs the
word in the same manner in the <i>Steel Glas</i>, n. d. (1576) 4<sup>o</sup>. The
passage in Gascoigne, which I perused long ago, was brought back to my
recollection by a note by the Rev. A. Dyce to Skelton's <i>Colin Clout</i>.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii38'>38</a>.&mdash;See Diogenes Laertius, transl. by Yonge, p. 226. Diogenes the
Cynic evidently had Thales in his mind when he said "that mathematicians
kept their eyes fixed on the sun and moon, and overlooked what was under
their feet."</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii40'>40</a>. <i>Of him that dreamed he fonde golde.</i></p>

<p>In <i>Pasquil's Jests</i>, we are told "how drunken Mullins of Stratford
dreamed he found golde." It is the same story.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii52'>52</a>. <i>Gelidus facet anguis in herba.</i>&mdash;Whoever edited this collection
of stories seems to have had a great fancy for quotations. Throughout
the <i>C. Mery Talys</i>, on the contrary, there is not a single instance of
this passion for extracts. Sir Thomas Overbury, in his <i>Characters</i> (if
at least they were written by him), ed. 1632, sign. K4, describes "An
Innes of Court man" as taking "<i>ends of Latine</i>, though it be false,
with as great confidence as ever <i>Cicero</i> could pronounce an oration." I
suspect that the <i>Mery Tales and Quicke Answeres</i> were collected by some
person more or less versed in the classics and in foreign authors, which
was probably not the case with the <i>C. Mery Talys</i>, which do not smell
so much of the inkhorn, as Gascoigne would have said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii54'>54</a>. <i>Breble-brable.</i></p>

<p>In <i>Twelfth Night</i>, act iv. sc. 2, Shakespeare makes the Clown use
<i>bibble-babble</i> in a similar sense; but afterwards in the same drama,
act v. sc.1, <i>brabble</i> is put for "a brawl."</p>

<p>This word is no doubt the same as the "pribbles and prabbles" which Sir
Hugh uses more than once in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>. See act v. sc.
5.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii60'>60</a>. <i>Of hym that payde his dette with crienge bea.</i>&mdash;Compare the
story of "the subtility of Kindlewall the lawyer repayed with the like
craft," printed in <i>Pasquil's Jests</i>, ed. Gilbertson, n. d. 4<sup>o</sup>.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii65'>65</a>. <i>All to.</i>&mdash;I fear that I too hastily adopted the self-suggested
notion that the former words might be read more properly as one word,
and in the sense which I indicated. Perhaps as <i>all to</i> or <i>al to</i> is
not uncommonly used by early writers in this way, though the meaning in
the present case is not particularly clear, it may be better to restore
the original reading.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii67'>67</a>. <i>Of the Inholders wyfe and her ii lovers.</i>&mdash;See Rowlands' <i>Knave
of Clubbs</i>, 1600, ed. Rimbault, p. 25.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii67'>67</a>. <i>Daungerous of her tayle.</i> So in the <i>Schole-house of Women</i>,
1542, the author says:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Plant them round with many a pin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ringed for routing of pure golde,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faire without, and foule within,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of their tailes have slipper holde."</span><br />
</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii70'>70</a>. <i>Of Mayster Vavasour and Turpin his man.</i></p>

<p>"A Lawyer and his Clerk riding on the Road, the Clerk desired to know
what was the chief Point of the Law. His Master said, if he would
promise to pay for their Suppers that Night, he would tell him; which
was agreed to. Why then, said the Master, good Witnesses are the chief
Point in the Law. When they came to the Inn, the Master bespoke a couple
of Fowls for Supper; and when they had Supped, told the Clerk to pay for
them according to Agreement. O <i>Sir</i>, says he, where's your
witness."&mdash;<i>Complete London Jester</i>, ed. 1771, p. 102.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii72'>72</a>. One of <i>Pasquil's Jests</i> is "how mad Coomes, when his wife was
drowned, sought her against the stream." It is merely a new application
of the present anecdote.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii75'>75</a>. <i>Of the foole that thought hym selfe deed.</i>&mdash;A story of a similar
character occurs in <i>The Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinarie, or, the
Walkes in Powles</i>, 1604, (repr. 1841, p. 19), where "mine Host" gives an
account of "how a yong fellow was even bespoke and jested to death by
harlots."</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii93'>93</a>. <i>He fell to a nyce laughyng.</i></p>

<p><i>Nice</i>, in the sense of <i>foolish</i>, is also used by Gower, who likewise
employs the substantive <i>nicete</i> in a similar way:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But than it were a <i>nicete</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To telle you, how that I fare!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Confessio Amantis</i>, lib. vi.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Chaucer employs the word in a similar sense very frequently. In the
<i>Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i>, is the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To telle his might my wit may not suffice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he can make of wise folks ful nice."</span><br />
</p>

<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii103'>103</a>. Crakers.&mdash;See the last edition of Nares, voce <i>Crake and
Craker</i>. But an earlier example of the use of the word than any given in
the Glossary occurs in Lupset's <i>Works</i>, 1546, 12<sup>mo</sup>
(<i>A Compendious Treatise teachying the waie of dying well</i>, fol. 34
<i>verso</i>; this treatise was first printed separately in 1541). In a
reprint of the <i>C. Mery Talys</i>, which appeared in 1845, the Editor, not
knowing what to make of <i>crake</i> and <i>craker</i>, altered them, wherever
they occurred, to <i>crack</i> and <i>cracker</i> respectively!</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii113'>113</a>. Ch' adde.&mdash;In <i>Wits Interpreter, The English Parnassus</i>, by J.
Cotgrave. 1655, ed. 1662, p. 247, is "the Devonshire Ditty," from which
the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cockbodikins, chil work no more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dost think chi labour to be poor?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No, no, ich chave a do&mdash;" &amp;c.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But this phraseology is not peculiar to Devonshire.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii113'>113</a>, note 2.&mdash;Some additional particulars of interest, relative to
ancient wines, may be found in <i>Morte Arthure</i>, ed. 1847, pp. 18, 20;
and in the <i>Squyer of Low Degre</i> (Ritson's <i>Ancient Engl. Met.
Renancees</i>, iii).</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii121'>121</a>. <i>Of the Courtear that ete the hot costerde.</i></p>

<p>"An arch Boy being at Table where there was a piping hot Applepye,
putting a Bit into his Mouth, burnt it so that the Tears ran down his
Cheeks. A Gentleman that sate by, ask'd him, Why he wept? Only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> said he,
because it is just come into my Remembrance that my poor Grandmother
died this Day Twelvemonth. Phoo! says the other, is that all? So
whipping a large Piece into his Mouth, he quickly sympathized with the
Boy; who seeing his Eyes brim-full, with a malicious Sneer Ask'd him,
Why he wept? A Pox on you, said he, because you were not hanged, you
young Dog, the same Day your Grandmother died."&mdash;<i>Complete London
Jester</i>, ed. 1771, p. 53.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_ii140'>140</a>.&mdash;<i>Of the Canon and his man. Note.</i></p>

<p>"When King James came into England, coming to Boughton, hee was feasted
by Sir Edward Montague, and his six sonnes brought upp the six first
dishes; three of them after were lords, and three more knights, Sir
Walter Montague, Sir Sydney, and Sir Charles, whose daughter Lady Hatton
is."&mdash;<i>Ward's Diary</i>, ed. Severn, p. 170-1.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>. <i>For at this foul araye.</i>&mdash;So, in the <i>Child of Bristow</i>, an
early metrical legend, we read:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When the burges the child gan se,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He seid then, benedicite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sone, what <i>araye</i> is this?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Some later writers thought it necessary to use this word with a
qualifying adjective, as <i>shrewd array</i>, &amp;c. thus, in fact, reducing it
to something like its ordinary and modern signification.</p>


<p>P. <a href='#Page_148'>148</a>, <i>note</i>. 1. See Pepys' <i>Diary</i>, 6th ed. I. 29. "They brought me a
draft of their drink in a brown bowl, tipt with silver, which I drank
off, and at the bottom was a picture of the Virgin with the child in her
arms, done in silver."&mdash;27th Feb. 1659-60. See also Brydges' <i>British
Bibliographer</i>, vol. ii. p. 109.</p>

very early period as a ground for satirical insinuations as to their
connection with the Evil One. In 1568, Ulpian Fulwell, a distinguished
writer of the Elizabethan era, published <i>A Pleasant Interlude intituled
Like will to Like quoth the Devil to the Collier</i>; and in the old play
of <i>Grim the Collier of Croydon</i>, the epithet grim was intended to
convey a similar idea. In <i>Robin Goodfellow His Mad Pranks and Merry
Jests</i>, 1628, however, Grim is the name of a Fairy.</p></div>

sense spelled in this manner. It continued to be used in its original
signification (<i>action</i> or <i>exploit</i>) even to the Restoration, perhaps
later. The most recent example of this employment with which the Editor
has happened to meet is at p. 29 of Mauley's <i>Iter Carolinum</i>, 1660,
where the writer speaks of "His Majesties Gests from Newcastle to
Holdenby in Feb. 1646." These <i>gests</i> were certainly no <i>jests</i>. Since
the former part of this note was written a more recent instance of the
use of <i>gest</i> in the sense in question has occurred to the Editor in the
<i>Life and Gests of S. Thomas Cantilupe, Gant</i>, 1674. 8vo.</p></div>

"Have with you to Walsingham" is mentioned as a musical composition in
Ward's <i>Lives of the Professors of Gresham College</i>. See also Burney's

adjuration, as was formerly very common, they were said, for brevity's

with what are intended for comic interlocutions. In March, 1502&mdash;3,
Elizabeth of York, consort of Henry VII, made an oblation of six
shillings and eightpence to "oure lady of Walsingham" (<i>Privy Purse
Expenses of Elizabeth of York</i>, edited by Nicolas, p. 3). This offering
may not appear very large, but it was thought a considerable sum to
devote to the purpose in those days; for in the <i>Northumberland
Household Book</i>, ed. 1827, p. 337, we find that the yearly offering of
the Earl of Northumberland (Henry Algernon Percy, 5th. Earl, b. 1478, d.
1527) to the same shrine was fourpence. There is a fuller account of the
Shrine of Walsingham, &amp;c., in Chappell's <i>Popular Music of the Olden

</p>
<p>
It is very commonly found in the early dramatists, and long before the
statute of James the First, <i>By cock</i> and similar phrases were used, in
order to evade the charge of profaning the name of the Deity. It is of
particularly frequent occurrence in Skelton's <i>Magnyfycence</i>:&mdash;
</p><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<i>Cr</i>[afty] <i>Con</i>[veyance]. Cockes armes, thou shalt kepe the brewhouse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">boule.</span><br />
</p><p><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Fol</i>[ye]. But may I drynke thereof whylest that I stare?"</span><br />
</p><p><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Magnyfycence</i> (Skelton's Works, ed. Dyce, i. 268).</span><br />
</p>
<p>
But this writer seems to have employed it rather fantastically than from
any desire to soften the oath; for elsewhere in the same piece we find
<i>By God, Goddes fote</i>, &amp;c. The practice of swearing had grown to such a
pitch in the time of Taylor the Water-Poet, that that writer says
(<i>Against Cursing and Swearing</i>, Works, 1630, i. 50):&mdash;"If the penalty
of twelve pence for every oath had been duly paid (as the statute hath
in that case provided) I doe verily beleeve that all the coyned money in
England would have been forfeited that way." Whitford, in his <i>Werke for
Housholders</i>, first printed about 1528 (edit. 1533, sign. c. ii et
seqq.), relates several remarkable judgments as having fallen, within
his personal knowledge, on profane swearers, who were as plentiful and
as reckless in the time of Henry VIII. as they were a century later.</p></div>

in vogue during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. is given by Taylor
the Water-Poet in his <i>Praise of Hempseed</i>. Cartwright, in his

it appears in a different form:&mdash;
</p><p>
"There was a rich Burgess of Antwerp, a Mercer by his trade, who was a
Bawd to his own Wife (though it was against his will or knowledge), but
I blame him not, for I doubt hee hath many more fellowes as innocent and
ignorant as himselfe, but this was the case, his wife wearing corke
shooes, was somewhat light-heel'd, and like a foul player at Irish,
sometimes she would beare a man too many, and now and then make a wrong
Entrance. The summe was, that shee lov'd a Doctor of Physicke well, and
to attaine his company shee knew no better or safer way, than to faine
her selfe sicke, that hee under the colour of visitation might feele her
pulses, and apply such cordiall Remedies as might either ease or cure
her. In briefe, the Doctor being sent for, comes and finds the Mercer
her husband walking in his shop with a neighbour of his, where after a
leash of <i>Congees</i>, and a brace of <i>Baza los manus</i>, the Mercer told him
that his Wife is a languishing sicke woman, and withall entreats him to
take the paines to walke up the staires, and minister some comfort unto
her: Master Doctor, who knew her disease by the Symptomes, ascends up
into the Chamber to his longing patient, staying an houre with her,
applying such directions and refections, that her health was upon the
sudden almost halfe recovered; so taking his leave of her (with promise
of often visitation) he comes downe into the shope, where the guiltlesse
<i>Bawd</i> her husband was, who demanding of the Doctor how all did above;
truely quoth hee, much better than when I came, but since I went up,
your wife hath had two such strange violent fits upon her, that it would
have grieved your very heart to have seene but part of one of
them."&mdash;Taylor's <i>Bawd</i> (Works, 1630, ii. 94).</p></div>

Smithfield; but it appears that even in the early part of Elizabeth's
reign building had commenced in this locality. Stow (<i>Survey of London</i>,
edit. 1720, lib. iii. p. 122) says:&mdash;"Long Lane, so called from its
length, coming out of <i>Aldersgate Street</i> against <i>Barbican</i>, and
falleth into <i>West Smithfield</i>. A Place also of Note for the Sale of
Apparel, Linnen, and Upholsters Goods, both Secondhand and New, but
chiefly for old, for which it is of note." See also p. 284 of the same
book, and Cunningham's <i>Hand Book of London</i>, edit. 1848, <i>in voce</i>,
with the authorities and illustrations there given. Rowlands, in his
<i>Letting of Humors Blood in the Head Vein</i>, 1611, Sign. C. 2 <i>verso</i>,
celebrates this spot as one of the principal haunts of the pawnbrokers.
In <i>Wits Recreations</i>, 1640 (edit. 1817, p. 109), there is the following
epigram:&mdash;
</p><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He which for 's wife a widow doth obtain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth like to those that buy clothes in <i>Long Lane</i>,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their faults I know not, but th' are manifold."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Day, in the <i>Parliament of Bees</i>, 1641, 4<sup>0</sup>, Sign. C, speaks very
disrespectfully of the population of Long Lane in his time. See
<i>Maroccus Extaticus</i>, 1595 (Percy Soc. ed. p. 16), Dekker's <i>Knights'
Conjuring</i>, 1607, ed. Rimbault, p. 54. Webster's Works, by Hazlitt, i.
